#### Experience
**Software Engineer @ Chartboost**

*San Francisco, California -- 2015-06 to present*

Chartboost ([chartboost.com](https://chartboost.com)) runs an ad network for mobile games. I was a member of the data team specializing in pipelines and web APIs.

**Spring 1 Alumnus @ the Recurse Center**

*Manhattan, New York -- 2015-02 to present*

The Recurse Center is a self-directed educational retreat for software developers. While there I started [Comic Gator](https://comicgator.com); a project that aggregates webcomics and allows users to generate RSS feeds. Notable features:

* [CDB](https://github.com/comicgator/cdb): the comic database designed in PostgreSQL and organized by sqitch.
* [Maestro](https://github.com/comicgator/maestro): a web API implemented in Scala/Play.
* [Lurker](https://github.com/comicgator/maestro/blob/master/app/services/Lurker.scala): a web crawler.
* [Line Cook](https://github.com/comicgator/maestro/blob/master/app/services/LineCook.scala): an RSS feed pipeline.
* [Lunch Time](https://github.com/comicgator/lunchtime): a web app for configuring feeds.

**Software Engineer @ Lexity --> Yahoo**

*Silicon Valley, California -- 2013-01 to 2014-08*

Lexity was a startup that built applications for small and medium-sized e-commerce merchants. Our products included: algorithmic bidding for comparison shopping sites, retargeting, and a sophisticated ROI tracking system. 

We were acquired by Yahoo in August of 2013 and became Yahoo Commerce Central ([commercecentral.yahoo.com](https://commercecentral.yahoo.com/)). I owned the merchant data extraction and normalization service.
