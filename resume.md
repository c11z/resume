### Experience 
#### Spring 1 Alumnus @ the Recurse Center
Manhattan, New York -- 2015-02 -> 2015-05

The Recurse Center is a self directed educational retreat for software developers. While there I worked on ComicGator ([comicgator.com](http://comicgator.com)); an app for reading and discovering webcomics. 

* [cdb](https://github.com/comicgator/cdb) -- PostgreSQL comic database. Version controlled and organized with Sqitch.
* [lurker](https://github.com/comicgator/lurker) -- Custom Scala scraper for webcomic sites. 
* [maestro](https://github.com/comicgator/maestro) -- Spray/Scala RESTful api wrapping cdb. 

#### Software Engineer @ Yahoo
Sunnyvale, California -- 2013-08 -> 2014-11

Lexity was acquired by Yahoo in August of 2013 and became Yahoo Commerce Central ([commercecentral.yahoo.com](https://commercecentral.yahoo.com/)).

* I migrated Channelmanager from AWS to Yahoo infrastructure and deployed across 2 co-locations.
* Scaled Channelmanager from 3 to 24 machines.
* Clustered the Merchant Database using Percona.
* Created data pipeline from MySQL to HDFS.

#### Channel Commando @ Lexity
Mountain View, California -- 2013-01 -> 2014-08

Lexity was a startup that built applications for small and medium sized ecommerce merchants. Our key products included: algorithmic bidding for comparison shopping sites, retargeting, and a sophisticated roi tracking system.

I was the largest contributer and maintainer of Channelmanager, a webapp that extracted and normalized product and order information from ecommerce platforms.

* Integrated and consumed dozens of ancient and terrible ecommerce APIs.
* Implemented an extremely defensive parsing and normalization abstraction.
* Experienced many flavors of APIs; some good, many horrible. Each required a novel solution to query efficiently.

### Skills

* Real stuff with Python, Scala, and Java.
* Commandlinefu with Python, *nix, and vagrant.
* Creation and consumption of api's; RESTful, RPC, SOAP.
* Designed and scaled RDBMS (MySQL and PostgreSQL).
